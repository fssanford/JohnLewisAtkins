### The Problem

Colonel Alexander McAllister (1715-1796) had three wives and reared two families.  Sailing to North Carolina from  Scotland in 1736 at the age of 21, he returned home briefly in 1739 to marry his fist wife, Mary McNeill.  She died on the voyage back to America and was buried at sea.  That same voyage, however, saw the birth of a baby girl, Jane (or Jean) Colvin, who 23 years later would become his third wife.

McAllister's first family consisted of the four children of his second wife, Flora McNeill.  The second family, the children of third wife Jane Colvin, included 7 children who had issue. So by the time we reach the third and forth generations, we're already considering a lot of descendants.  And by the time we get to links between third and forth generations documentation thins out.  Wills, and some grave markers, help confirm links between the first three generations (links between third and fourth generations -- early 1800s, before 1850 -- documentation becomes thin) sometimes wills mention grandchildren require identifying the parent because names were reused so frequently

A particular example of the is the question of the relationship between John Lewis Atkins and his purported father John Atkins (and Jennet McNeill, granddaughter of Col. McAllister).


John Atkins ('Sr') appears to have died intestate.



So we have to relie on a single genealogical work plus other bits and pieces of evidence that tend to support the 'secondary' account.  This work is the Genealogical Record of the Descendants of Col. Alexander McAllister of Cumberland County, N.C. (also of Mary and Isabella McAllister) by Rev. D.S. McAllister Pastor of the Presbyterian Church of Fairview, S.C. (Richmond 1900)

The work seems to be a compilation of material provided by family members

While the work does not cite sources, it is safe to conclude that it was based on first hand account of close family members.



Unlike similar undertakings involving generations that moved (mostly in a westward direction across the rapidly expanding territory of the United States), they didn't move around a lot

This is not the work of a Compiler looking back from 1903, say, at two, two-and-a-half centuries to the beginning of a family just over from Europe and beginning to spread out geographically through wars, changes of government, and migratory efforts (searching for more land).


Rev. D.S. (David Smith) McAllister, great grandson of col McAllister and his third wife Jane Colvin (II. -4, 3. b. 1845), began work in 1870 aunt Charity McAllister Wade, NC -- cumberland county) near Cape Fear River, location of Old Bluff PC (col. one of the founders).  Aunt Charity became his surrogate mother when birth mother died when he was 11 months old.  She never married and was murdered in her home in 1889 by what the Compiler only described as a "maniac."

The person who was responsible for supplying much of the information was well acquainted (in many cases personally) with the many descendants of the Colonel.

The work evolved over a period of about 30 years finally being published in 1900

Mary, Grisella, Isabella all sisters of col, Hector a brother


(aunt) Charity McAllister (1802-1889) daughter of Alex II (granddaughter of col)

(uncle) Hugh McLean
Mrs. Mary Shaw Greene, Lillington (g-g-gd Isabella)

Children of Jennett McNeill and John Atkins

- Ann before 1798-unknown

- Janet Atkins 1798–1870

- James Alexander Akins 1805–1822

- John Lewis Atkins 1807–1873​​

- Flora Isabella Atkins 1814–1899​​

- Katherine Atkins 1816–1886

5 out of the 6 children are named either for grandparents or their uncles and aunts: the first (Ann) named for her father's mother Anne Hutchines, the second named for mother's mother Janet, the first two boys named for brothers of their father (James and Lewis), and the next daughter named for two of her mother's sisters (Flora and Isabella).  Aunt Flora in turn bears the name of her grandmother, the second wife of Col Alexander.

John Lewis names one son 'Benjamin Ica' using the name of his grandfather


While there may be more in the household, at least the ones listed here potentially fit in --
There is nothing that I can find in any of these enumerations (1800-1850) that contradicts the genealogical accounts


## JohnLewisAtkins.md

All the online databases claim (without citation) that John Lewis Atkins (1807-1873) was the son of John Atkins (1765-1857).  This is also the claim of the citation-free McAllister Genealogy.  But is there any 'primary' evidence for this?
databases: ancestry family trees, wikitree, dar/sar applications: piggy-backed

any of these sources need be not rejected automatically as long as the information they present can be corroborated from other sources.

published in 1900, MacGen is the work of a family member (ggs) born in 1845 -- a time when grand children and great grandchildren of Col. McAllister were still living.  The author, descended from the third wife of Col McAllister, Jane Colvin

purpose of work: descent of Alexander, Mary, Isabella
great grand son of Col. McAllister

Atkins surname 3 generations

names were reused a lot.  [p. 10 Grissella McAllister died unmarried, but the reappearance of her beautiful name from time to time among the generations of her relations shows that her memory was precious.]

This can the cause of confusions, but it can also hint at continuities between generations as when, for example, childrens are named for parents' siblings.  This is true of the McAllisters, McNeills, Atkins, etc.  These families also intermarried a lot, so it can get really confusing.

Most of line from Col. McAllister is fairly well documented with wills and grave stones.



1. no other Johns: census records 1790 - 1850
2. John 'Sr.' on stone
3. John Lewis likely named for John Sr's brother Lewis (multiple examples)
4. all together in SPC Cemetery
5. dates of births fit
6. Names were reused a lot.



The period following the Revolution through the first half of the Nineteenth Century is particularly challenging, because of the limited amount of information available in census records

Wills were particularly important -- the two major forms of wealth, land and slaves.

The reuse of names is reflected sometimes in the wording of will where an heir is identified not only by his or her name but by a parent's name

Senior-Junior distinction by itself can not provide documentation of paternity, but it can constitute a strong suggestion that there are two people nearby with the same given name and that it was desireable to distinguish the two.
